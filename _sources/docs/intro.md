## Next-generation quantum chemistry software for molecular properties

VeloxChem {cite}`veloxchem` is a Python-based open source quantum chemistry software developed for the calculation of molecular properties and simulation of a variety of spectroscopies.

VeloxChem features interactive program access through Jupyter notebooks as well as large-scale calculations in contemporary high-performance computing (HPC) environments. A comprehensive presentation of the former desktop aspect is provided in the [eChem](https://kthpanor.github.io/echem) book and this manual will focus on the latter HPC aspect.

### Key capabilities

- Kohnâ€“Sham Density Functional Theory (DFT)
- Time-dependent DFT (TDDFT)
- Optical and X-ray absorption
- Electronic circular dichroism (ECD)
- Polarizabilities and dispersion coefficients
- Complex polarization propagator (CPP)
- Response theory for pulses
