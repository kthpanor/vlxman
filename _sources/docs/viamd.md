# VIAMD software
(sec:viamd)=

VIAMD is an interactive visualization tool originally developed for molecular dynamics analysis, but recent updates have introduced support for VeloxChem output. VIAMD can now directly read the HDF5 (.h5) files produced by VeloxChem, which contain detailed orbital information. This enables users to efficiently render and analyze molecular orbitals and spectra from VeloxChem calculations within the VIAMD environment, providing a powerful and seamless workflow for exploring quantum chemical results visually.
