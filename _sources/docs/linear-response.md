# Linear response

## Polarizability

The linear electric-dipole polarizabilty is determined from the linear response function {cite}`Norman2018`

$$
\alpha_{\alpha\beta}(\omega) =
- 
\langle\langle \hat{\mu}_\alpha; \hat{\mu}_\beta 
\rangle \rangle_\omega
$$

The frequencies of the perturbing electric field is specfied as a `list` or in terms of a frequency region with a frequency point separation in parenthesis.

## General linear response functions

A general linear response function

$$
\langle\langle \hat{\Omega}; \hat{V} 
\rangle \rangle_\omega^\gamma
$$

can be requested, referring to the linear response of the molecular property associated with $\hat{\Omega}$ due to the perturbation associated with $\hat{V}$ and oscillating with the angular frequency $\omega$. The damping term $\gamma$ is associated with the inverse lifetime and enters into the calculation only if a complex response function is requested by setting `complex` to `yes`.

(sec:c6)=
## C6 dispersion coefficients

The $C_6$ dispersion coefficient relates to the electric-dipole polarizability according to

$$
C_6 = \frac{3\hbar}{\pi}
\int^{\infty}_0 \bar{\alpha}_A(i\omega) \bar{\alpha}_B(i\omega) 
d\omega
$$

where $\bar{\alpha}_A{i\omega}$ is the isotropic average of the polarizability tensor for molecular system $A$.

The integral over the positive imaginary frequency axis is performed in VeloxChem using a Gaussâ€“Legendre quadrature after substituting the integration variables according to

$$
    i\omega^I = i\omega_0 \frac{1-t}{1+t},\quad d\omega^I = \frac{-2\omega_0 dt}{(1+t)^2},
$$

where a transformation factor of $\omega_0 = 0.3$ a.u. is used. The user may specify the number of frequency points used in the quadrature, or otherwise a default value is adopted. The polarizabilities are calculated from the complex polarization propagator (CPP), or complex linear response function {cite}`Norman2018`.

## Laser pulse propagation

VeloxChem allows for calculation of the linear electric dipole response for the frequency region of a single Gaussian-envelope pulse deemed sufficiently large (using the @pulses module).

The time-domain shape parameters for this pulse may be specified by the user, optionally storing a collection of pertinent results in an HDF5-formatted file or a plaintext ASCII file whose name may be specified by the user.

An example of an input file that when run will carry out such a calculation is given below. For more documentation about the available keywords, please consult the source file whose path from the VeloxChem root folder is src/pymodule/pulsedrsp.py. Note in particular that the default of carrier envelope phase may need adjustment to match your desired setup.

```
@jobs

field_cutoff_ratio: 1e-5

carrier_frequencies: 0.325
pulse_widths: 50

@end
```

If HDF5-formatted data was produced during this calculation, that data may used for plot generation using the script located at `utils/pulsed_response_plot.py` from the VeloxChem root folder.

Also note that other standard python modules such as `matplotlib` must be installed on the system from which this script is run. The script will take the HDF5-formatted data produced during the VeloxChem calculation and generate a plot of the real and imaginary frequency-domain electric dipole polarizability, a representation of the perturbing field in the frequency domain, the resulting (real-valued) first-order dipole moment correction in the time domain and a representation of the perturbing field in the time domain.

For more information and further description of how to run this script, please consult the documentation written inside it.
